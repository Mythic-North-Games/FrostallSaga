### Requirements

- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) version 7 or more

### Installation

1. Make sure you have all the requirements correctly installed on your system
2. Clone or pull this repository
3. Install and setup commit linter and pre commit by running `npm install`.

> Now, every time you want to commit, a formatter will automatically format the staged `.cs` files for you before commiting, then a commit linter applying the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention will prevent you from writing bad formatted commits.
